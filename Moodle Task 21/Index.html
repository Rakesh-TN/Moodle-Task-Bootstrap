        <h3>What is a Web Developer?</h3>

        <p>Web developers work independently as freelancers or with company teams to create websites. These professionals may focus on front-end or back-end development, depending on their specific roles.</p>

        <p>The front end includes designing sites and coding what users see, while back-end development involves writing code to ensure proper functionality. Web developers may also become webmasters to provide maintenance, updates, and troubleshooting when needed.</p>

            <h3>History of Web Developers</h3>
        
            <p>Though conceived in the 1980s, the public Internet only took off in 1993 after the introduction of the Mosaic web browser. Developers then began to write code with HTML. With this common language, websites could communicate over interconnected networks.</p>

            <p>By the early 2000s, the Internet had become a major platform for commerce, education, and culture. Later, the creation of the mobile app put the Internet into more users' hands and changed the nature of web development again.</p>

            <p>Perhaps the best-known web developer is Tim Berners-Lee, who created HTML and launched the World Wide Web. Other famous developers include Lea Verou, co-editor of several CSS specifications, and Håkon Wium Lie, who created CSS.</p>

            <h3>What Does a Web Developer Do?</h3>
        
            <p>Web development includes building technical front-end and/or back-end code that informs site functionality. Web developers may work exclusively on front-end code, back-end code, or both, and many modern jobs also require overlap in web design. These professionals may work independently on a freelance basis or with marketing or IT departments.</p>

            <p>Entry-level jobs often require only a small amount of formal education and training. As the Internet continues to expand, so does the demand for talented web developers, making this career an attractive option. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that web development jobs will grow by 23% between 2021 and 2031 — much faster than the national average growth for all occupations.</p>
